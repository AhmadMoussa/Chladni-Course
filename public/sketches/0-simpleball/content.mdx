This is an mdx panel to display additional information about the sketch â€” a bouncing ball p5 sketch. 

Basically the sketches sit in the public folder, and the component gets the path to fill out these panels.
The sketch.html file additionally contains a message listener to receive slider and code updates from the editor and sliders.

Things to fix still for this component:

1. When rerunning the sketch, if it has global lets or consts it throws an error
2. Handling errors during auto-run of the code 
3. When rerunning the sketch it inserts a new canvas, now I'm manually removing it XD
